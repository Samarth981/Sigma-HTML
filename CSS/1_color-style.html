    <h1>Iron mane</h1>
    <p>As superhero comics became more popular, Marvel began replacing its previous comic book lines with superheroes.
        The monster-themed anthology series Tales of Suspense began running Iron Man stories alongside more traditional science-fiction and horror stories, featuring Iron Man on each cover.
        Iron Man's first appearance, "Iron Man is Born!", was in Tales of Suspense #39, released in December 1962 with a cover date of March 1963. In 1964, the science-fiction and horror stories were removed entirely,
        with the series running only Iron Man and Captain America stories.</p>

        working from a plot by editor Lee as well as a plot assist from Marvel secretary-receptionist Flo Steinberg.</p>
